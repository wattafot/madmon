# Pokemon Clone in Godot (C#)

## 🎮 About This Project
This is a multi-part series where I recreate a **Pokémon Red/Blue**-style game using **Godot 4 and C#**. The goal is to build a classic turn-based RPG with mechanics inspired by the original Pokémon games. 

As a kid, **Pokémon Red** was the first game I ever owned on a Game Boy, and it left a lasting impression. Now, I want to recreate the experience using modern game development tools while keeping things **simple, efficient, and to the point**.
